# Il-2: Battle of Stalingrad Mission Planner

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gavincabbage/bos-mission-planner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gavincabbage/bos-mission-planner)

Welcome to the `bos-mission-planner` repository. This repository houses the code behind the Il-2: Battle of Stalingrad Mission Planner tool, a simple client-side javascript application based primarily on [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

Check out the [latest stable release at bosmissionplanner.com](http://bosmissionplanner.com), or the [beta region](http://beta.bosmissionplanner.com) to see work in progress.

## Issues and Enhancements

If you'd like to report a bug or request an enhancement, please [open an issue](https://github.com/gavincabbage/bos-mission-planner/issues).

## Contributing

Interested in contributing to this tool? Feel free to fork the project and open a PR when you're ready to contribute back. The code is under the MIT license, so you can basically do whatever you like with it.

## Development Setup

Clone the repository. In the repository directory, run `npm install` followed by `bower install` to fetch dependencies. Then navigate to the index file in a web browser (e.g. `file:///path/to/index.html`) to access the site. Currently most of the app is in `map.js` and `controls.js`. There aren't any unit tests yet because I'm lazy and learning how to use Leaflet, but eventually my anxiety will get the better of me and I'll write some tests.
